    <string name="rd">This module outlines the principles of essential care for all people seeking health care, including those
        with MNS conditions, and their carers. The first section of this module covers the general principles of clinical care
        and aims to promote respect for the privacy of people seeking care for MNS conditions, foster good relationships between
        health care providers, service users and their carers, and ensure care is provided in a non-judgmental, non-stigmatizing,
        and supportive manner. The second section covers essentials of mental health clinical practice and aims to present
        healthcare providers with an overview of the assessment and management of MNS conditions in non-specialized settings.

As a health care provider, make every effort to respect and promote the will and preference of people with MNS conditions and support and engage them and their carers in the most inclusive way. Persons with MNS conditions are often more vulnerable to human rights violations. Therefore, it is essential that in the health care setting, providers promote the rights of people with MNS conditions in line with international human rights standards, including the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability (CRPD)*.</string>

    <string name="ja">Assessment of Physical Health</string>
    <string name="jaa">Conducting an assessment for MNS conditions involves the following steps. First, the presenting complaint is explored, then a history is obtained including asking about past MNS issues, general health problems, family MNS history, and psychosocial history. Observe the person (Mental Status Exam), establish a differential diagnosis, and identify the MNS condition. As part of the assessment, conduct a physical examination and obtain basic laboratory tests as needed. The assessment is conducted with informed consent of the person.</string>

    <string name="pe">Management of Physical Health</string>
    <string name="ge">Persons with MNS disorders are at higher risk of premature mortality from preventable disease and therefore must always receive a physical health assessment as part of a comprehensive evaluation. Be sure to take a proper history, including both physical health and MNS history, followed by a physical health assessment to identify concurrent conditions and educate the person about preventive measures. These actions must always be undertaken with the person’s informed consent.</string>

    <string name="title_activity_depression">Depression</string>
    <string name="dep">
        People with depression experience a range of symptoms
including persistent depressed mood or loss of interest and
pleasure for at least 2 weeks.\n\n
People with depression as described in this module have
considerable difficulty with daily functioning in personal, family,
social, educational, occupational or other areas.\n\n
Many people with depression also suffer from anxiety symptoms
and medically unexplained somatic symptoms.\n\nDepression commonly occurs alongside other MNS conditions as
well as physical conditions.\n\n
The management of symptoms not fully meeting the criteria
for depression is covered within the module on Other Significant
Mental Health Complaints. Go to » OTH.
    </string>


    <string name="psy">
        \n\nThe psychoses module covers management of two severe mental
health conditions, psychosis and bipolar disorder. People with
psychosis or bipolar disorder are at high risk of exposure to stigma,
discrimination and violation of their right to live with dignity.\n\n
Psychosis is characterised by distorted thoughts and perceptions,
as well as disturbed emotions and behaviours. Incoherent or irrelevant
speech may also be present. Symptoms such as hallucinations –
hearing voices, or seeing things that are not there; delusions –
fixed, false beliefs; severe abnormalities of behaviour – disorganised
behaviour, agitation, excitement, inactivity, or hyperactivity;
disturbances of emotion – marked apathy, or disconnect between
reported emotion and observed affect, such as facial expression
and body language, may also be detected.\n\n
Bipolar disorder is characterized by episodes in which the person’s
mood and activity levels are significantly disturbed. This disturbance
consists on some occasions of an elevation of mood and increased
energy and activity (mania), and on others of a lowering of mood
and decreased energy and activity (depression). Characteristically,
recovery is complete between episodes. People who experience only
manic episodes are also classified as having bipolar disorder.

    <string name="epi">Epilepsy is a chronic noncommunicable disorder of the brain,
characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures. Epilepsy is one
of the most common neurological disorders and with proper
treatment, can be well controlled in the majority of people.\n\n
Epilepsy has many causes. It may be genetic. Epilepsy may occur
in people who have a past history of birth trauma, brain injury
(including head trauma and strokes), or brain infections. In some
people, no cause may be identified.\n\n
Seizures are caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain and
are of two types: convulsive and non-convulsive. Non-convulsive
epilepsy has features such as change in mental status while convulsive
epilepsy has features such as sudden abnormal movements,
including stiffening and shaking of the body. The latter is associated
with greater stigma and higher morbidity and mortality. This module
covers only convulsive epilepsy.</string>

    <string name="cmh">DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDER is an umbrella term covering
disorders such as intellectual disability as well as autism spectrum
disorders. These disorders usually have a childhood onset, impairment
or delay in functions related to central nervous system maturation,
and a steady course rather than the remissions and relapses
that tend to characterize many other mental disorders.\n\n
BEHAVIOURAL DISORDERS is an umbrella term that includes
specific disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD) and conduct disorders. Behavioural symptoms of varying
levels of severity are very common in the general population. Only
children and adolescents with a moderate to severe degree of psychological,
social, educational or occupational impairment in multiple
settings should be diagnosed as having behavioural disorders.\n\n
EMOTIONAL DISORDERS are among the leading mental healthrelated
causes of the global burden of disease in young people.
Emotional disorders are characterized by increased levels of anxiety,
depression, fear, and somatic symptoms.
</string>
    <string name="dem">Dementia is a chronic and progressive syndrome due to changes
in the brain. Although it can occur at any age, it is more common
in older people. Dementia is a significant cause of disability and
dependency among older people worldwide; it has a physical,
psychological, social, and economic impact on carers, families,
and society at large.\n\n
The conditions that cause dementia produce changes in a person’s
mental ability, personality, and behaviour. People with dementia
commonly experience problems with memory and the skills needed
to carry out everyday activities. Dementia is not part of normal
ageing. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause, however,
dementia can be caused by a variety of diseases and injuries to the
brain. People with dementia often present with forgetfulness or
feeling depressed. Other common symptoms include deterioration
in emotional control, social behaviour, or motivation. People with
dementia may be totally unaware of these changes and may not
seek help. Family members may notice memory problems, changes
in personality or behaviour, confusion, wandering, or incontinence.

 </string>

    <string name="sub">Disorders due to substance use include both drug and alcohol
use disorders and certain conditions including acute intoxication,
overdose and withdrawal.\n\n
ACUTE INTOXICATION is a transient condition following intake of
a psychoactive substance resulting in disturbances of consciousness,
cognition, perception, affect, or behaviour.\n\n
OVERDOSE is the use of any drug in such an amount that acute
adverse physical or mental effects are produced.\n\n
WITHDRAWAL is the experience of a set of unpleasant symptoms
following the abrupt cessation or reduction in dose of a psychoactive
substance; it has been consumed in high enough doses and for a
long enough duration for the person to be physically or mentally
dependent on it.\n\n
HARMFUL USE is a pattern of psychoactive substance use
that damages health. This damage may be physical, e.g. liver
disease, or mental.
</string>

    <string name="sui">Suicide is the act of deliberately killing oneself. Self-harm is a
broader term referring to intentional self-inflicted poisoning or
injury, which may or may not have a fatal intent or outcome.
Any person over 10 years of age experiencing any of the following
conditions should be asked about thoughts or plans of self-harm
in the last month, and about acts of self-harm in the last year:\n\n
» Any of the priority MNS conditions. See Master Chart ( MC)\n
» Chronic pain\n
» Acute emotional distress\n\n
        CLINICAL TIP:\n
Asking about self-harm does NOT provoke acts of self-harm. It often reduces
anxiety associated with thoughts or acts of self-harm and helps the person feel
understood. However, try to establish a relationship with the person before asking
questions about self-harm. Ask the person to explain their reasons for harming
themselves.

    <string name="oth">This module aims to provide basic guidance on management
of a range of mental health complaints not covered elsewhere in
this guide. Some of these complaints may be similar to depression,
but upon closer examination are distinct from the conditions
covered in this guide.\n\n
    Other mental health complaints are considered significant
when they impair daily functioning or when the person seeks
help for them. Other mental health complaints can be due
to stress.\n\n
    This module should not be considered for people who meet the criteria for any of the mhGAP priority conditions (except self-harm).\n
This module should only be used after explicitly ruling out depression.\n
This module should be used when helping adults. In case the person is a child or adolescent, go to » CMH.</string>

    <string name="section_format">Hello World from section: %1$d</string>
    <string name="help1">The mhGAP-IG is a model guide and it is essential that it is
adapted to the unique national or local situation. Users may
select a subset of the priority conditions or interventions to
adapt and implement, depending on the context.</string>

    <string name="help2">The mhGAP App begins with “Essential Care and Practice”,
        a set of good clinical practices and general guidelines for
        interactions of health care providers with people seeking
        mental health care. All users of the mhGAP-IG should
        familiarize themselves with these principles and should
        follow them as far as possible.\n\n

        The mhGAP App includes a “Master Chart”, which provides
information on common presentations of the priority
conditions. This guides the clinician to the relevant modules.
The most serious conditions should be managed first.
mhGAP-IG 2.0 has a new addition to the Master Chart –
Emergency Presentations of Priority MNS Conditions.
This section has been added to help identify emergency
situations and direction to management guidelines.\n\n
The modules, organized by individual priority conditions, are
a tool for clinical decision-making and management. Each
module is in a different colour to allow easy differentiation.
There is an introduction at the beginning of each module
that explains which condition(s) the module covers and a
quick overview describing key assessment and management
steps.
 </string>
    <string name="jam">Mental, neurological and substance use (MNS) disorders are highly prevalent,
accounting for a large burden of disease and disability globally. There remains a
wide gap between available health systems capacity and resources, what is urgently
needed, and what is available to reduce the burden.\n\n
    The key objectives of mhGAP
are to reinforce the commitment of governments, international organizations and other
stakeholders to increase the allocation of financial and human resources for care
of MNS disorders and to achieve much higher coverage with key interventions in lowand
middle-income countries.</string>
    <string name="help3">The Assessment section is presented in a framework of
flowcharts with multiple clinical assessment points. Each
module starts with common presentations of the suspected
condition, from which there are a series of clinical assessment
questions one should move down answering yes or no,
which directs the user to move on for further instructions to
reach a final clinical assessment. It is important that users of
the mhGAP start at the top of the assessment and move
through all the decision points to develop a comprehensive
clinical assessment and management plan.\n\n
The Management section consists of intervention details
which provide information on how to manage the specific
conditions that have been assessed. This includes more
technical psychosocial and pharmacological interventions
when appropriate.\n\n
The Follow-up section provides detailed information on
how to continue the clinical relationship and detailed
instructions for follow-up management.\n\n
The mhGAP uses a series of symbols to highlight
certain aspects within the modules. A list of the symbols
and their explanation is given on the following page.
Throughout the modules, important points are also
highlighted as key clinical tips.\n\n
Also included is a module on Implementation of mhGAP-IG,
which provides summary steps on how to implement
mhGAP.\n\n
At the end of the guide, a glossary of terms used in
mhGAP is provided.</string>
