    <string name="rd">This module outlines the principles of essential care for all people seeking health care, including those
        with MNS conditions, and their carers. The first section of this module covers the general principles of clinical care
        and aims to promote respect for the privacy of people seeking care for MNS conditions, foster good relationships between
        health care providers, service users and their carers, and ensure care is provided in a non-judgmental, non-stigmatizing,
        and supportive manner. The second section covers essentials of mental health clinical practice and aims to present
        healthcare providers with an overview of the assessment and management of MNS conditions in non-specialized settings.

        <b>Activities of daily living (ADLs)</b>\n
        A concept of functioning – activities of daily living are basic activities that are necessary
        for independent living, including eating, bathing and toileting. This concept has several assessment
        tools to determine an individual’s ability to perform the activity with or without assistance.\n\n

        Marked restlessness and excessive motor activity, accompanied by anxiety \n\n
        Agranulocytosis\n
        A blood disorder in which there is an absence of granulocytes  (a type of white blood cell). It is an
        acute condition involving a severe and dangerous leukopenia, also known as drug-induced secondary agranulocytosis.\n\n
        <b>Akathisia</b> \n
         A subjective sense of restlessness, often accompanied by observed excessive movements
        (e.g. ﬁdgety movements of the legs, rocking from foot to foot, pacing, inability to sit or stand still).\n\n

        <b>Akinesia</b> \n
        The absence or lack of voluntary movement. A state of difﬁculty in initiating movements or changing from one motor
        pattern to another that is associated with Parkinson’s disease. \n\n
        <b>Altered mental status</b> \n

        See delirium and confusional state. \n\n

         <b>Alzheimers disease</b> \n
         A primary degenerative cerebral disease of unknown etiology in  the majority of cases with characteristic
        neuropathological and neurochemical features. The disorder is usually insidious in onset and develops slowly but
        steadily over a period of several years.\n\n
         <b>Anticholinergic side effects</b> \n
       Anticholinergic medicines block the effects of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors. Anticholinergic
        effects include dryness of the mouth, urinary frequency or retention, palpitations and sinus tachycardia.\n\n
       <b>Aplastic anaemia</b> \n
       A disease characterized by the inability of  blood stem cells to generate new mature cells. This disease is also
        characterised by low levels of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. This disease may present with
        pallor, fatigue, dizziness, increased risk of infection or increased bruising or bleeding.\n\n
     <b>Distractibility</b> \n
     Difﬁculty concentrating and focusing on tasks; attention is easily diverted by extraneous stimuli.\n\n
        <b>Dystonia</b> \n
     Sustained muscle contraction or involuntary movements that can lead to ﬁxed abnormal postures. See tardive dyskinesia.\n\n
        <b>Eclampsia</b> \n
        Any condition affecting pregnant women, characterized by seizure or convulsions newly arising in pregnancy. The
        condition is often associated with pregnancy-induced hypertension, convulsions, seizure, anxiety, epigastric pain,
        severe headache, blurred vision, proteinuria, and oedema that may occur during pregnancy, labour, or the puerperium.\n\n
     <b>Convulsion, convulsive movement</b> \n
    Clinical or subclinical disturbances of cortical function due to a sudden, abnormal, excessive, and disorganized
        discharge of brain cells (see seizure). Clinical manifestations include abnormal motor, sensory and psychic phenomena.\n\n

As a health care provider, make every effort to respect and promote the will and preference of people with MNS conditions and support and engage them and their carers in the most inclusive way. Persons with MNS conditions are often more vulnerable to human rights violations. Therefore, it is essential that in the health care setting, providers promote the rights of people with MNS conditions in line with international human rights standards, including the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability (CRPD)*.</string>

    <string name="ts">Treat existing comorbidities concurrently with the MNS disorder. Refer to/consult with specialists, if needed. Provide education on modiﬁable risk factors to prevent disease and encourage a healthy lifestyle. To support physical health of persons with MNS conditions, health care providers should: – Provide advice about the importance of physical activity and a healthy diet. – Educate people about harmful alcohol use. – Encourage cessation of tobacco and substance use. – Provide education about other risky behaviour (e.g. unprotected sex). – Conduct regular physical health checks and vaccinations. – Prepare people for developmental life changes, such as puberty and menopause, and provide the necessary support. – Discuss plans for pregnancy and contraception methods with women of childbearing age.</string>

    <string name="ja">Assessment of Physical Health</string>
    <string name="jaa">Conducting an assessment for MNS conditions involves the following steps. First, the presenting complaint is explored, then a history is obtained including asking about past MNS issues, general health problems, family MNS history, and psychosocial history. Observe the person (Mental Status Exam), establish a differential diagnosis, and identify the MNS condition. As part of the assessment, conduct a physical examination and obtain basic laboratory tests as needed. The assessment is conducted with informed consent of the person.</string>

    <string name="ge">Persons with MNS disorders are at higher risk of premature mortality from preventable disease and therefore must always receive a physical health assessment as part of a comprehensive evaluation. Be sure to take a proper history, including both physical health and MNS history, followed by a physical health assessment to identify concurrent conditions and educate the person about preventive measures. These actions must always be undertaken with the person’s informed consent.</string>
